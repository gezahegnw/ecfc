          Three Important Steps On Your Journey
        </h3>
        <p>
          Everyone "connects" in different ways. Depending on your life stage,
          personality, and circumstances – we each have different needs. We get
          it. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. But, there is always a next
          step towards Christ. Here are some some important next steps you
          should consider.

        <div className="paraDiv">
          <p>
            <strong style={{ color: "red" }}>Step 1 -</strong> Do you have
            questions about Jesus? Questions like, "Who is He and Why does He
            care about me?" Or, "What's the point of knowing Him?" Maybe you
            want to know how to have a relationship with Him. These are great
            questions! So, we offer classes for you and your kids called
            Discovering Christ.

            <strong style={{ color: "red" }}>Step 2 -</strong> Another important
            step is joining a Small Group. A Small Group is a group of people
            who get together regularly to develop some good friends and grow
            their faith.

          <p>
            <strong style={{ color: "red" }}>Step 3 -</strong> Serving others is
            vital step in your journey. Jesus said "Whoever wants to be my
            disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and
            follow me." Join a serving team that fits your unique gifts,
            desires, and passions.
