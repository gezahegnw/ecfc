            <h3>Toward A HEART For God</h3>
            <p>
              Ultimately, spiritual formation is about the heart. This is why:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It is mentioned hundreds of times times and in many different
                contexts throughout scripture (it’s a great study to do for your
                devotions –
                <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=heart&qs_version=NIV">
                  here’s a list
                </a>{" "}
                of everywhere it’s mentioned)
              </li>
              <li>
                We are told: “Above all else, guard your heart, for everything
                you do flows from it.’<strong> Proverbs 4:23 </strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                The “heart” (in scripture) generally encompasses our thinking,
                our will and our emotions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We want the hearts of our kids to lean toward God in all areas of
              their life so that everything they do is influenced “toward God”.
            </p>

          <div class="col">
            <h2>What Is Children’s Ministry?</h2>
            <h3>Here’s how we define children’s ministry</h3>
            <p>
              Partnering with parents to guide kids toward a HEART for God.{" "}
            </p>
            <h2>Partnering with parents</h2>
            <p>
              Parents are designed to be and usually are the primary influence
              in a child’s spiritual formation. Therefore… If we are not
              intentionally partnering with them, then most of what we do is
              fairly irrelevant in the spiritual life of the child. It doesn’t
              matter what model you gravitate toward (traditional children’s
              ministry, Orange, D6 . . . whatever) children’s ministry is family
              ministry; family ministry is children’s ministry. And we can forge
              effective partnerships in any model. The best model is more about
              the environment and leadership of your church.
            </p>
            <h2>To Guide Kids</h2>
            <p>
              In the end, both parents and those of us in the church are guides.
              Of course, we need to do all we can to influence children in their
              faith – and what we do (or don’t do) most definitely influences
              them – but all of us have a free will to choose, and one day all
              of us do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his
              hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them.{" "}
              <strong>Matthew 19:13</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              but Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not
              hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”
              <strong>Matthew 19:14</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              15 When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.
              <strong>Matthew 19:15</strong>
